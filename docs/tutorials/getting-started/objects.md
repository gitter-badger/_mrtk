# Working with objects

We are now going to add a cube to your project
which you will be able to interact with in the
MRTK rotate, move, scale bounding box style.

### Adding our cube

1. In your `SampleScene` create a 3D cube.
2. Set the postition to `<0,0,1>` and scale to `<0.1, 0.1, 0.1>` and rotation to anything.

This will make the cube a reasonable size and
place it in front of the user when your app starts.
