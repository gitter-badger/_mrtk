# Connecting to XR devices

### Connecting with the HL2

In order to debug or deploy, you will need to connect your HL2
to your dev system. You can apparently do this with a USB cable, but I have had difficulties here. There is also an open issue for the remote player in Unity, so until that is fixed we have to remote debug or deploy. I prefer deploy, it seems to run faster / have a shorter dev cycle.

This is how to connect via wifi.
