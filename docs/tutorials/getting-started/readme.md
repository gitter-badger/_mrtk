# Getting Started

This section will help you get setup with the tools
and walk you through some basic projects and concepts.

This is primarily directed at Hololens 2 development, however
adapting for another platform should be relatively easy.
MRTK is designed to deploy to all platforms and in most cases
you will need to add some packages and configuration... tbd.
