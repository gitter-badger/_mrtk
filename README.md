# _mrtk

Docs, Tutorials, and Code Samples for the Mixed Reality Toolkit.

These will mainly focus on Unity + MRTK using the HoloLens 2.
If you have another device, these should be easily adaptable.
Unity + MRTK supports almost all products and platforms out there
including: Win, iOS, Android, and most VR systems.
We will also add further docs as we develop these ourselves.
If you have your own to add, we are more than happy to get a PR!
